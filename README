	TTT: Tele Traffic Tapper (version 1.1)

					98/07/09

ttt is yet another descendant of tcpdump but it is capable of real-time,
graphical, and remote traffic-monitoring.  ttt won't replace tcpdump,
rather, it helps you find out what to look into with tcpdump.

Features:
    - Automatic Ranking of Protocols and Hosts:
	ttt monitors the network and automatically picks up the main
	contributors of the traffic within the time window (60 sec by
	default).  You can see the behavior of the traffic of the
	past 60 seconds.  The graphs are updated every second by
	default. 

	ttt presents two separate graphs in a window.  One for a
	protocol breakdown and the other for an ip-host breakdown.
	By doing this, you can tell from the graphs something like
	"hey, the traffic jumps up!  host A and host B are talking
	over ftp."

    - Real-Time Monitoring:
	The key mechanism of ttt is the real-time traffic ranking.
	The scheme is twofold:
	(1) 1st stage:
	    For each interval (1 sec by default), ttt adds up the
	    packet length of each protocol and host within the
	    interval.  At the end of the interval, the top 10
	    contributors are picked up by both protocol and host.
	(2) 2nd stage:
	    ttt keeps track of the ranking by the peak traffic within
	    the time window (60 sec by default), and updates the top 6
	    in the auto-scaled graphs at every interval.

    - Remote Monitoring with IP-Multicast support:
	Because the 1st stage process reduces the traffic information
	to a minimum, the output of the 1st stage can be transferred
	over the network to a remote host and the 2nd stage process
	can be done at the remote host.

	The max packet size is 272 bytes.  With the 1 sec default interval,
	it takes about 2Kbps, which would be negligible for most LAN
	settings and would be acceptable even for WAN settings.  The
	ttt traffic can be reduced further with a longer interval.  
	It's my intension to make ttt a useful tool to monitor heavily-
	congested backbone networks from my desktop.

	ttt uses UDP to send the traffic info and supports IP-Multicast.
	If you install a ttt probe with multicast, a group of people
	can see the traffic graph on his/her own desktop. (yes, you
	don't need to be a "root" to see the graph any more!)

    - IPv6 Aware: (experimental)
	ttt knows about IPv6 packets.  For example, an IPv6 host name is
	shown like "fe80::0800:2001:a237" and a ftp over IPv6 is shown
	as "ftp-data/ip6".
	
	Note that when you enable the IPv6 option, the system takes a
	bit more memory to keep 128-bit IPv6 addresses.

    - Portable:
	ttt uses two portable libraries for packet-capturing and
	graph-drawing, and ttt itself is fairly	portable.
	For packet capturing, "libpcap" of tcpdump from Lawrence
	Berkeley Laboratory is used.
	For auto-scale graphs, "libBLT" for Tcl/Tk from AT&T Bell
	Laboratories is used.
	So, if you already have tcpdump and Tcl/Tk on your machine,
	there would be no problem to install ttt.

    - Easy to customize:
	Many network administrators have their own requirements.
	Customizing ttt to trace some specific protocol would be
	straightforward.  (so, I have skipped analysis of apple talk,
	decnet, osi, etc.)
	Also, since GUI part is based on Tcl/Tk, you can set
	parameters from a Tcl script, or you can set some parameters
	afterwards from Tcl Shell. 

	Currently, ttt understands ethernet frame, llc/snap frame of
	802.3 and FDDI. 

Installing TTT:
    Getting the source code:
	http://www.csl.sony.co.jp/person/kjc/software.html
	  or
	ftp://ftp.csl.sony.co.jp/pub/kjc/ttt-1.1.tar.gz

    First, you have to install "libpcap" and "libBLT (2.1, 2.3 or 2.4)"
    (and, of course, Tcl/Tk).  Those are placed in the ttt distribution 
    directory at SonyCSL or they can be found at:

	ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap-*.tar.Z

	http://www.tcltk.com/blt/

    I myself is currently using libpcap-0.4a6 and blt2.4c with Tcl8.0p2
    and Tk8.0p2 on FreeBSD-2.2.6 and Solaris2.5.1.

    libpcap is available for most platforms.  (it comes with tcpdump.)
    [ I made a patch which makes use of the BIOCSBLEN ioctl of bpf.
    apply this if you are using a 4.4BSD descendant and the kernel
    drops too many packets. ]

    <README of the BLT2.4 says:>
	This release has been compiled and tested with versions:

	Tcl 7.5 / Tk 4.1
	Tcl 7.6 / Tk 4.2
	Tcl 8.0 / Tk 8.0

	[Tk 8.1a2 can work, but needs replacements for a few functions that
	used to be in Tcl 8.0.  Since 8.1 is still experimental (alpha), it's
	a lesser priority. But if you absolutely need BLT for 8.1a2, please
	let me know.]

Building TTT:
   
    Run ./configure

	By default, the ttt files are installed
	in "/usr/local/{bin,lib/ttt,man}".
	use "--prefix=path" to change the install directory.

	available switches are:
		--with-tcl=DIR
		--with-tk=DIR
		--with-blt=DIR
		--with-pcap=DIR
		--with-cc=CC		
		--enable-ipv6, --disable-ipv6
    
    Then, just type "make".  It will create 3 programs.

	ttt	  --	a standalone traffic monitor program.

	tttprobe  --	a network probe program for remote-monitoring.

	tttview	  --	a viewer program for remote-monitoring

     You can create other tools manually:
	tttrelay  --	a program which just relays ttt packets,
			which might be useful when you have a probe
			behind a firewall or to bridge
			multicast-capable networks.

	ttttextview --	a text based viewer for debugging.

Running TTT:
	To run "ttt" or "tttprobe", you must be a "root" for most
	systems since only root is allowed to access the network
	filter device.

	To run "ttt", just type "./ttt" in the ttt directory, a window
	with two graphs will pop up.
	You need to be in the ttt directory since some scripts
	are required in the current directory.

	To do remote-monitoring, run a probe on one machine by typing
	"./tttprobe hostname" where the hostname is the name of the other
	machine.  On the remote machine, just type "./tttview".
	To use multicast, use "./tttprobe -multi" and "./tttview -multi"
	instead.

Examples:

 point-to-point monitoring:
    when you run a probe on hostA and a viewer on hostB:
	[hostA]# tttprobe hostB
	[hostB]% tttview

    you can also use dotted ip address for A.
	[hostA]# tttprobe 43.27.98.80

  multicast:
    when using the default multicast address:
	[hostA]# tttprobe -multi
	[hostB]% tttview -multi

    this is equivalent to
	[hostA]# tttprobe 224.8.8.0
	[hostB]% tttview -addr 224.8.8.0

  to set the interval to 3 sec.
	[hostA]# tttprobe -interval 3000 hostB

  to specify interface "ef1":
	[hostA]# tttprobe -interface ef1 hostB

  relaying packets:
    if hostA can't talk to hostB directly, but hostC can reach both
    hostA and hostB:
	[hostA]# tttprobe hostC
	[hostC]% tttrelay hostB
	[hostB]% tttview

  multicast relay:
	[hostA]# tttprobe -multi
	[hostC]% tttrelay -addr 224.8.8.0 hostD
	[hostD]% tttrelay 224.8.8.0
	[hostB]% tttview -multi

  if you are getting paranoid on long-latency:
	[hostA]# tttprobe -port 6000 hostB
	[hostB]% tttrelay -port 6000 hostA -dport 6001
	[hostA]% tttrelay -port 6001 hostB -dport 6001
		...........
	[hostB]% tttrelay -port 6008 hostA -dport 6009
	[hostA]% tttrelay -port 6009 hostB -dport 6009
	[hostB]% tttview -addr 6009

Tcl vars:
  ttt and tttview read a tcl script "ttt.tcl" at startup.  you can
  set some parameters in this file. if the following tcl variables are
  set, they are read as ttt parameters.

  ttt_colors: 	  colors to use.
  ttt_nohostname: no hostname translation.
(ttt only)
  ttt_interface:  packet capture interface device.  
  ttt_interval:   interval in msec.
(tttview only)
  ttt_portno:	  udp port number to receive ttt reports. 
  ttt_viewname:   my address to receive ttt reports. (same as -addr option)

  also you can change some parameters from Tcl Shell of "ttt" and "tttview"
  as a ttt command.
  currently, only interval (ttt only) and no hostname translation are
  supported.

examples:
  % ttt get interval
  1000
  % ttt set interval 3000
  3000

  % ttt get nohostname
  0
  % ttt set nohostname 1
  1

How to read graphs:

The basic rule of the protocol breakdown is that when ttt does further
breakdown, ttt doesn't show the parent protocol.  For example, ttt
shows "icmp/ip" but not "udp/ip" since udp is further decomposed to
udp services.  
One exception is "ip/ether" which is a good indicator of the total
traffic. (why not using the total ethernet frames?  currently, the
underlying systems do not report consistent information other than IP.
for now, using the IP traffic seems to be much better.)

For the IP traffic, src and dest are ORed.  Thus, when you see two hosts
have same traffic pattern, it is most likely that those two talk to each
other.  Similarly, when you see two protocols (e.g. nfsd/udp and
1023/udp) have same traffic pattern, they are most likely the server
and the client.
You can filter out src hosts or dst hosts from tcl shell.

  % ttt filter src

  % ttt filter dst

  % ttt unfilter src

  % ttt unfilter dst

tcp/udp service names are read into the internal tables at the
startup.  If your system supports gethostent(3) and HAVE_GETHOSTENT
is set for compilation, host names are also read at the startup.

Pcap stat line shows the capture status from "libpcap", "recv" means
how many packets are received by the packet filter and "drop" means
how many packets are dropped in the kernel.
Ttt stat reports how many reports are lost.

Packet Capture Performance:

The biggest problem seems to be the performance of the packet filter.
If the traffic seems too low, it is likely that the kernel drops
packets before ttt gets them.  

If you have the packet drop problem and your system has 4.4BSD BPF,
try the patch "libpcap.diff" included in this directory.  The original
libpcap-0.0.6 doesn't use the "set buffer length" ioctl provided by
bpf.  This improves the performance of my note pc (Dec HiNote Ultra
CT475(DX4/75MHz) with 3Com 3C589C PCMCIA Ethernet Card / BSD/OS2.1)
from less than 1Mbps to about 3Mbps. 
(But this may cause longer filter delay for small traffic.  I'm not
sure about this.)

My Sun Ultra1/Solaris2.5 can capture more than 8Mbps out of 10Mbps
Ethernet.

Some Notes:

Currently, "libpcap" is still in an alpha release and the packet
report other than IP is not consistent among different platforms.
(it's a problem of different packet filter implementation of the
underlying operating systems.)
We would benefit from libpcap when it becomes more stable and supports
more platforms. And, anyway, I guess LBL's effort is more dependable
than mine :-)
