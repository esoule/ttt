.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fITtt\fP monitors the network and automatically picks up the main
contributors of the traffic within the time window (60 sec by
default).  You can see the behavior of the traffic of the
past 60 seconds.  The graphs are updated every second by
default. 
\fITtt\fP presents two separate graphs in a window.  One for a
protocol breakdown and the other for an ip-host breakdown.
\fITtt\fP also accepts a \fItcpdump\fR output as input.
To run
.I ttt
You must have read access to
.IR /dev/bpf* .
.br
\fITtt\fP reads a startup script named \fIttt.tcl\fP in the current
directory or in the system default directory (default is
\fI/usr/local/lib/ttt\fP). 
Once started, \fIttt\fP goes into Tcl Shell.  
To quit \fIttt\fP, type \fIquit\fP.

You can change \fIttt variables\fP from Tcl Shell or from the startup script.
See the comments in \fIttt.tcl\fP for more details.

Also, you can do remote monitoring using \fItttprobe\fP and
\fItttview\fP programs.

\fITtt\fP requires libpcap and libBLT.  libBLT requires Tcl/Tk.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-interface
Listen on \fIdevice\fP.
If unspecified, \fIttt\fP searches the system interface list for the
lowest numbered, configured up interface (excluding loopback).
Ties are broken by choosing the earliest match.
.TP
.B \-interval
Sets the interval to update the graph in \fImsec\fP. The default is 1000 msec.
.TP
.B \-dumpfile
Uses a dumpfile produced by \fItcpdump -w\fR as input.
.TP
.B \-speed
Specifies the acceleration factor of the replay speed.  
\fI-speed 10\fR will replay a 10-minute-dumpfile in 1 minute.
.TP
.B \-yscale
Specifies the scale of y axis.
\fIK\fR and \fIM\fR represent 1000 and 1000000 respectively.
