- check
	default address of viewer
	default multicast address
	default port number

- rewrite node.c
	simple binary trees and 32-entry size-tables are too inefficient
	for backbone networks.  use heap-sort or balanced-tree.

- ip fragmentation: current version supports only udp.

WISH-LIST:

- bar graph support

- it would be nice if the system can be configured hierarchically and
  the total traffic of subnets can be displayed.
